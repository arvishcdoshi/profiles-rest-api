We have to specify the model manager that we're going to use fot the objects and this
is required because we need to use our custom user model with the Django CLI.. so Django
needs to have a custom model manager for the user model so it knows how to create users
and control users using the Django command line tools...

ex(look in our code)
objects = UserProfileManager()

-->In the parenthesis, we will pass in the class we're going to create the manager class
we will also  create UserProfileManager class further...
